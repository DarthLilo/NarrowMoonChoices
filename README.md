Selene is the Greek Goddess of the moon.

## Selene's Choice keeps every run unique while also making the game more difficult

This is achieved by shuffling around the moons and only providing the crew with 3 moons. (Configurable value)

The first moon that is picked by the shuffle is guaranteed to be free, the ship will also route to it automatically.

The other moons are completely random (excluding the company of course, that will always be there.)

All moons that were not picked by the shuffle will be hidden from the terminal and have their routes locked.

## Shuffling Occurs when...

**A new lobby is opened** (The shuffle seed is based on the lobbyID)

**The crew is ejected** (The shuffle seed is the lobbyID plus the number of times the crew has been ejected)

Then either...

**Everyday** (The shuffle seed will be the previous level's seed)

Or...

**On a new Quota** (The shuffle will be the lobbyID plus the new quota amount)

By default the shuffle will occur daily, this is configurable.

All players require the mod.

If you find any bugs it will be faster to tell me on discord tbh.
